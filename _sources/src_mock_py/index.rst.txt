Python Package
==============

Here you find the documentation for the thermodynamics class, output class and
relevant calculations required to run the tests in pytest for any arbitray
microphysics scheme (with a suitable Python wrapper).

Also here you find a mock "microphysics scheme" (not physically meaningful!) and
its wrapper to illustrate how a scheme with a Python interface and a suitable
wrapper could be used in this repository.
